Unturned plugin to host info management and cross-plugin storage sharing.

**Locker** is a Rocket (LDM) Unturned plugin that stores information and data across several other plugins is a type of plugin that acts as a central repository for information that is shared among multiple other plugins. This plugin can be used to store information such as player data, item statistics, and server settings. It allows other plugins to access and modify this shared data, enabling them to work together seamlessly and effectively. This can greatly enhance the functionality of the game and make it more dynamic and engaging for players. Such plugin would be often utilized by servers or communities to have a central hub for data management, instead of having individual plugins storing data in their own way.
