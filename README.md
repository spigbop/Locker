Unturned plugin to host info management and cross-plugin storage sharing.

**Locker** is a Rocket (LDM) Plugin that is very simple in premise but enables very smooth compatibility between plugins using Locker API and easy server storage management, especially for those server owners that own a network of servers! Locker makes it easy to store data, retrieve that data with extremely simple functions like `Locker.API.LockerData.GetTable("MyPlugin").Get("MyData")` to store **text, numbers, locations without a need to convert** and still run async saves to your **Folder** or **MySql Database**!

Head on to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/spigbop/Locker/releases) page to download the Locker plugin.
